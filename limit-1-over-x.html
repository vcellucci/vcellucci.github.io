                        Recalling the definition of a limit
                    <div class="text-center border rounded p-4 shadow m-4 lead" style="background-color: white;">
                        <p>
                            The statement \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \) has the following precise definition. Given any
                            real number \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists another real number \(\delta > 0\) so that
                            $$ if \;0 < |x-a| < \delta, \\ then \; |f(x) - L | < \varepsilon $$ </p>

                    </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given that \(f(x) = {1 \over x}\), let's prove that \(\lim_{x \to 4} f(x) = {1 \over 4} \).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, we try to find a good \(\delta\), we can start off with
                        $$
                        \begin{align} \\
                        \left| {1 \over x} - {1 \over 4} \right| &< \varepsilon \\ \left| {4-x} \over {4x} \right| &<
                            \varepsilon \\ {1 \over 4} \cdot {1 \over x} |4-x| & < \varepsilon \\ {1 \over 4} \cdot {1
                            \over x} |x-4| & < \varepsilon \\ |x-4| & < 4x \varepsilon \end{align} $$ </p>
                            <p>
                                Ok, we have our \(|4-x|\), but, we can't have \(\varepsilon\) dependant on \(x\). Let's
                                see what we can do about that
                                \(1/x\) on the left, since we have an opportunity to get rid of it on the right hand
                                side. Knowing that we want to keep
                                \(x\) close to \(4\), let's declare the following
                                $$
                                \begin{align}
                                |4-x| < 1 \\ -1 < x < 1 \\ 3 < x < 5 \\ \end{align} $$ Ok, this is looking interesting,
                                    let's choose the small \(x\), namely \(3\), because, you know, mathematicians aren't
                                    afraid of thinking small... keeping that in mind let's take the reciprocal of this
                                    inequality $$ {1 \over 5 } < {1 \over x} < {1 \over 3} $$ And, there we have it, we
                                    can use \(\delta=12\varepsilon\) provided that \(|x-4| < 1\), or more precisely,
                                    \(\min(12\varepsilon, 1)\). Why can we say this? <ul>
                                    <li>The fact that \(1/x > 0\)</li>
                                    <li>The fact that \(1/4\) is in the interval \(({1\over 5}, {1\over 3})\)</li>
                                    </1>
                            </p>

                            <div class="rounded shadow m-3 p-3" style="background-color: white;">
                                <p>
                                    Let \(f(x) = {1 \over x }\). Then \(\lim_{x \to 4} f(x) = {1 \over 4} \).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Using the precise definition; If \(0 < |x-4| < \delta\), then \( \left |f(x) - {1
                                        \over 4} \right| < \varepsilon \) </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Let \(\varepsilon > 0\), if \(|x-4| < 1\) then
                                                \(\delta=\min(12\varepsilon,1)\) and \({1\over x}< {1\over 3}\).
                                                Therefore we have $$ \begin{align} \left |f(x) - {1 \over 4} \right|
                                                &=\left |{1 \over x} - {1 \over 4} \right| \\ &=\left| {4-x} \over {4x}
                                                \right| \\ &={1 \over 4} \cdot {1 \over x} |4-x| \\ &={1 \over 4} \cdot
                                                {1 \over x} |x-4| \\ &< {1 \over 4} \cdot {1 \over 3} |x-4| \\ &< {1
                                                \over 4} \cdot {1 \over 3} \delta \\ &< {1 \over 12} \delta \\ &< {1
                                                \over 12} 12 \varepsilon \\ \left |f(x) - {1 \over 4} \right| &<
                                                \varepsilon \\ \end{align} $$ <i class="fas fa-smile"></i>
                                        </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Let's not lose track of our goal here. What we just proved, was that if we satisfy the
                                conditions provided in the proof, the function will be within a certain \(\varepsilon\)
                                of \(1/4\). Or, to put it another way, the output will be as close as we want it to
                                \(1/4\).
                                You can test these out by plugging some values into \(x\) and see what happens.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With a little bit of thought, we can see that is false to say \(\lim_{x \to 0} {1 \over
                                x} = 0 \). Or put another way, it's not true
                                that for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), we can find a \(|x-0|\) that makes \(|f(x) - 0| <
                                    \varepsilon\). There is no \(|f(x)|\ < \varepsilon\)! Or, let's say we want to be
                                    within \(1/100\) of \(0\). So we have to satisfy \(|x-0| < 1/100\) and \(|f(x) - 0|
                                    < 1/100\). Observe $$ \begin{align} \text{ Let } x &=1/100\\ |x - 0| &=|1/100 -0| \\
                                    &=|1/100| \\ \end{align} $$ And we have $$ \begin{align}\\ \left|{1 \over x
                                    }-0\right| &=\left|{1 \over {1 \over 100}}\right| \\ &=1 \cdot 100=100 \end{align}
                                    $$ As a matter of fact, the smaller we make \(|x-0|\), the larger \(|f(x)-0|\)
                                    becomes. We say that \(f(x) \to \infty\), which reads "F of x, approaches infinity."
                                    And if we think about this for a moment, it makes perfect sense, if we keep in mind
                                    that $$ {1 \over x }=1 \cdot {x^{-1}} $$ So how do we prove that \(\lim_{x \to 0}
                                    {1\over x}=\infty \)? Or put another way, how do we prove that the function grows
                                    without bounds, as the input approaches \(0\)? First, let's, define precisely what
                                    it means for a limit to approach infinity. <div
                                    class="text-center border rounded p-4 shadow m-4 lead"
                                    style="background-color: white;">
                                    <p>
                                        \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\) means that for every positive number \(M\)
                                        there is a positive number \(\delta\) such that
                                        $$ f(x) > M \text{ whenever } 0 < | x-a| < \delta $$ </p>

                </div>
                This is basically saying what we just showed previously, but in a more formal way. We can make \(f(x)\)
                bigger than any number, whenever we make \(x\)
                close to \(a\), but not \(a\) itself, hence the \(0 <| x-a| < \delta\). </p>
                    <p>
                        All right, let's prove it for \(1/x\). First we need to find a \(\delta\) that works. So, we
                        want \(\delta\), such that \(f(x) > M\)
                        $$
                        f(x) > M = {1\over x } > M \text{ whenever } 0< |x-0| < \delta\\ \begin{align}\\ \implies 1 &>
                            xM \\
                            \implies x &< {1 \over M} \text { whenever } |x| < \delta \end{align} $$ So now we have
                                \(\delta={1 \over M}\) <div class="rounded shadow m-3 p-3"
                                style="background-color: white;">
                                <p>
                                    By definition \(\lim_{x \to 0} {1\over x} = \infty\) means that for every positive
                                    number \(M\) there is a positive number \(\delta\) such that
                                    \({1\over x} > M \text{ whenever } 0 < | x-0| < \delta\) </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Let \(M > 0\), choose \(\delta = {1 \over M}\). If \(0 < | x-0| < \delta \).
                                                Observe $$ \begin{align} |x| &< \delta \\ x &< \delta\\ {1 \over x} &>
                                                {1 \over \delta}\\
                                                {1 \over x} &> {1 \over {1\over M}}\\
                                                {1 \over x} &> M
                                                \end{align}
                                                $$

                                                Thus by definition, \(\lim_{x \to 0} {1\over x} = \infty\)

                                        </p>
                                        <i class="fas fa-smile"></i>


            </div>

            <p>
                Ok, let's do more testing. Let's use \(\delta = 1/10\), so that means we have to choose a \(|x| <
                    1/10\). So, let's use \(1/100\). Plugging it into \(1/x\), remembering that \(M=10\) we get $$ {1
                    \over {1\over 100}}=1 \cdot {100 \over 1}=100> 10
                    $$
            </p>
            <p>
                I know, it seems like a lot of hand waving. But that's part of mathematics, I like to call it "creative
                trickery".
