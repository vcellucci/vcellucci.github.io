                        What is a limit? In a nutshell, a limit of a function, is how a function behaves at certain
                        input point. The function may not be defined at that input. But we may want to know how it
                        behaves around that input point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with a function. A linear function $$f(x) = 2x$$
                        Ok, we know that the value of $$f(4) = 8$$
                        But, let's say I want to be guaranteed the output to the function is within a certain range of
                        8.
                        Let's say
                        \(1/10\) of 8. Or more precisely I want
                        $$|f(x) - 8| < {1 \over 10}$$ Still with me? Let's solve for x $$ -{1 \over 10} < 2x - 8 < {1
                            \over 10} $$ $$ 8 - {1 \over 10} < 2x < 8 + {1 \over 10} $$ $$ {79 \over 10} < 2x < {81
                            \over 10} $$ $$ {79 \over 20} < x < {81 \over 20} $$ Converting to decimals $$ 3.95 < x <
                            4.05 $$ So what we have here, is a value for \(x\) that will guarantee the value of our
                            function will be within \(1 \over 10\) of 8. Or put another way, if we input a value greater
                            than 3.95 and less than 4.05, \(f(x)\) will be within \(1 \over 10\) on either side of the
                            number line!! </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's test this. Let's try \(x = 3.96\). Pumping this into my calculator, I get the
                                value
                                7.92. That's definitely within 0.1!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's try the other side, say \(x = 4.04\). This gives me 8.08. Again! It's within 0.1
                                of 8!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, let's test this with values outside of the interval \((3.95, 4.05)\). With 3.94 and
                                4.06 I
                                get 7.88 and 8.12 respectively. Those values are definitely not within 0.1 of 8!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ok, cool. But even more interesting is that we can guarantee the value of \(f(x)\) to be
                                within
                                any range, \(\varepsilon\).
                                $$|2x - 2a| < \varepsilon$$ $$=- \varepsilon < 2x - 2a < \varepsilon$$ $$=- {\varepsilon
                                    \over 2 } < x - a < {\varepsilon \over 2} $$ Hey! This is starting to look a lot
                                    like the precise definition of a limit! In fact, what we're saying here, is if we
                                    want the output to be within \(\varepsilon\) of \(f(x)\), then our input has to be
                                    within \(\varepsilon / 2\). </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Let's use a concrete example.
                                        We want the output to be within 1 unit of \(f(10)\). This means that our input
                                        must be within \(|{\varepsilon \over 2}|\), or \(|{1\over2}|\), or more
                                        precisely,
                                        the interval \((9.5, 10.5)\), because \(10 - 0.5 = 9.5\) and, \(10 + 0.5 =
                                        10.5\). If we plug these in, we'll get 19 and 21 respectively. So, if
                                        we input anything greater than 9.5 and less than 10.5, then we'll get the output
                                        to our
                                        function within 1 unit.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>


                                        Let's try for within \(1/100\) of \(f(10)\)
                                        $$ {1 \over 100} * {1 \over 2} = {1 \over 200 }$$

                                        Converting to decimal we get 0.005, and plugging those in we get
                                        $$ 10 - 0.005 = 9.995 $$
                                        $$ 10 + 0.005 = 10.005 $$
                                        $$ f(9.995) = 19.99 $$
                                        $$ f(10.005) = 20.01 $$

                                        We can keep doing this by making \(\varepsilon\) as tiny as we want, the output
                                        will always be within \(\varepsilon\), in this example, it's 20. And *this* is
                                        the essence of the precise definition of a limit. We can get \(f(a)\) as close
                                        as possible to \(f(x)\), by making the input value \(a\) as close as possible to
                                        the
                                        input value \(x\).
                                        All
                                        this is taking for granted that the limit actually exists!

                                    </p>
