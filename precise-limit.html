                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without further ado, here is the precise definition of a limit, taken from <a
                            href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kouba/CalcOneDIRECTORY/preciselimdirectory/PreciseLimit.html">here</a>
                    <div class="text-center border rounded p-4 shadow m-4 lead" style="background-color: white;">
                        <p>
                            The statement \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \) has the following precise definition. Given any
                            real number \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists another real number \(\delta > 0\) so that
                            $$ if \;0 < |x-a| < \delta, \\ then \; |f(x) - L | < \varepsilon $$ </p>

                    </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Continuing with our simple linear function \(f(x) = 2x\). We already know how to make \(f(x)\)
                        within any \(\varepsilon\). We did so by solving
                        $$ |f(x) - f(a)| < \varepsilon $$ $$ |2x - 2a| < \varepsilon $$ $$ -\varepsilon < 2x - 2a <
                            \varepsilon $$ $$ -{\varepsilon \over 2 }< x - a < {\varepsilon \over 2 } $$ So as you can
                            see, \({\varepsilon \over 2 }\) is our \(\delta\) in the above definition. So the definition
                            is saying, if we make \(x\) as close as possible to \(a\), we can make the output of the
                            function within \(\varepsilon\) . </p>
                            <p>
                                Ok, so let's prove that \(\lim_{x \to 10} f(x) = 20 \) with what we learned so far.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I always start by working out the \(\delta\) first, then work backward to link them
                                together.
                                $$ |2x - 2a| < \varepsilon $$ $$=2| x - a | < \varepsilon $$ $$=| x - a | < {\varepsilon
                                    \over 2} $$ Remember that \(|x-a| < \delta\). So, \(\delta={\varepsilon \over 2}\).
                                    Here is the complete proof. <div class="rounded shadow m-3 p-3"

                                    <p>
                                        Using the precise definition; If \(0 < |x-10| < \delta\), then \( |f(x) - 20 | <
                                            \varepsilon \) </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Let \(\varepsilon > 0 \). Choose \(\delta ={ \varepsilon \over 2 } \).

                                                Assume that \(0 < |x-10| < \delta\). Observe $$ \begin{align} |f(x) -

                                                    \varepsilon \end{align} $$ </p>

                                            <p>Remember that we chose \(\delta ={ \varepsilon \over 2 } \). That's why
                                                we can make \(2\delta = 2{ \varepsilon \over 2 }\)</p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Ok, let's try a more complicated example. Let's show that the \(\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 4 \), and let
                    \(f(x) = x^2\). Remember that we try to workout out \(\delta\) so we can use it later. Here \(a =
                    2\)
                    $$ |x^2 - a^2| < \varepsilon $$ $$ |x^2 - 4| < \varepsilon $$ Using difference of squares $$ | x - 2
                        ||x+2| < \varepsilon \\ | x - 2 | < {\varepsilon \over |x+2|} $$ Ok, cool, we have our
                        \(|x-2|\), but what do we do about the \(|x+2|\)? Well, remember that we want \(\delta\) to be
                        as small as possible, which makes \(|x-2|\) close to 2. So it's perfectly fine to assume \(|x-2|
                        < 1\). Why 1? We could have chosen \(1/10\) or 2. But one is usually nice and easy to work with.
                        So let's assume that \(|x-2| < 1\) and find a \(\delta\) that works. $$ |x-2| < 1 \\ -1 < x-2 <
                        1 \\ 2-1 < x < 2 + 1 \\ 1 < x < 3 $$ Ok, now let's make it look like \(|x+2|\) by adding 2 $$ 2
                        + 1 < x + 2 < 3 + 2 \\ 3 < x + 2 < 5 \\ $$ And since everything is positive, we can say $$ 3 < |
                        x+2 | < 5 $$ Now we're getting close. Remember that when taking a reciprocal in an inequality,
                        the symbols flip $$ {1 \over 5} < \left| { 1 \over x+2 }\right| < {1 \over 3} \\ (\varepsilon)
                        {1 \over 5} < \left| (\varepsilon){ 1 \over x+2 }\right| < (\varepsilon){1 \over 3} \\
                        {\varepsilon \over 5} < \left| {\varepsilon \over x+2 }\right| < {\varepsilon \over 3} \\ $$
                        There's two choices here for \(\delta\), but remember our goal is to make \(\delta\) as small as
                        possible. So we chose \(\varepsilon/5\). </p>
                        <p>
                            Recall that we worked out \(| x - 2 | < {\varepsilon \over |x+2|}\) and that \(|x+2| < 5\),
                                so we can say \(| x - 2 | < {\varepsilon \over 5}\). </p>
                                <p>
                                    And there we have it, we have just shown that \(|x-2| < {\varepsilon \over 5}\)
                                        provided that \(|x-2| < 1\). Or, \(|x-2| < \min({\varepsilon \over 5}, 1)\), and
                                        that \(|x+2|< 5 \). Put another way, we have shown that if \(|x-2| < 1\) then
                                        \(|x+2| < 5\). </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Let's analyze what we did a little further. Keeping in mind that
                                            $$
                                            if \; |x-2| < 1, \;then \; 3 < | x+2 | < 5 $$ We have $$ \begin{align} |x^2
                                                - 4| &=|x-2||x+2| \\ |x^2 - 4|& < |x-2|5 \\ |x^2 - 4|& < 5|x-2|
                                                \end{align} $$ Note that we showed that \(|x+2| < 5\), provided that
                                                \(|x-2| < 1\). That means \( |x-2||x+2| < 5|x-2|\). </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Let's test this out by plugging 2.9 into \(|x^2 - 4|\), since
                                                    \(|2.9-2| < 1\) $$ |2.9^2 - 4|=4.41 $$ plugging the same into $$
                                                        \begin{align}\\ 5|x-2| &=5|2.9 -2|\\ &=5(0.9)\\ &=4.5\\
                                                        \end{align} $$ And \(4.41 < 4.5\)! </p>
